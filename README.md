# Learning React

Just a place to come back to for brushing up basics.

Code can be difficult to understand, so I'd recommend to refer <a href="Doc.docx">Doc</a>(which also contain scode blocks) to look for basic tips, tricks and issues that I confronted and resolved, might come in handy for beginners.

Small learning projects:
One -
	Has a toggle button that toggles the visibility of contents
	Has "Persons" component that has values sent across using props.
	Persons has methods which can entertain changing name(by changing contents of input box), and deletion(by tapping on the card) of Person card.
	It also has dynamic css which changes text properties of middle text based on the number of persons card.
